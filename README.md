# Spotify Top Tracks 2024: Cross-Platform Analysis & Radio Bias Study

**Comprehensive analysis of music streaming metrics** revealing platform-specific patterns and statistically significant content-based biases in radio programming.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes Spotify's "Top Tracks 2024" dataset combined with metrics from Apple Music, YouTube, and TikTok. Through exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, we investigate:

- **Cross-platform correlations** between different engagement metrics
- **Factors predicting track quality** (Track Score)
- **Content-based biases** in radio airplay distribution
- **Temporal trends** in music perception over the past decade

## 🎯 Key Findings

### 1. 📻 Radio Programming Bias
- **Child-friendly tracks receive more radio airplay** than explicit tracks
- **Statistically significant** (Fisher's exact test: p < 0.05)
- Confirmed by both visualization (box plots) and hypothesis testing

### 2. 🔗 Platform Correlation Patterns
- **TikTok operates independently** from other platforms (weak correlations)
- **YouTube shows strong internal consistency** (views ↔ likes: ρ = 0.83)
- **Apple Music correlates moderately** with multiple platforms:
  - Radio airplay (Airplay Spins): ρ = 0.58
  - Spotify Playlist Count: ρ = 0.69
  - Spotify Playlist Reach: ρ = 0.67

### 3. 🎵 Track Quality Predictors
- **Spotify Playlist Reach correlates strongest with Track Score** (Spearman's ρ = 0.50)
- **Apple Music Playlist Count** is the second strongest predictor
- The relationship **approximates linearity** (significant Pearson's r)

### 4. 📈 Temporal Trends
- **Post-2015 tracks score significantly higher** than pre-2015 releases
- Suggests either quality improvement or rating inflation over time

### 5. 📅 Dataset Characteristics
- **Covers first half of 2024** (latest track: June 14, 2024)
- **Low-scoring tracks predominate** (Track Score < 250)
- **Non-explicit tracks constitute majority**
